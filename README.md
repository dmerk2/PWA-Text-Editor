## Description

The JATE Text Editor is a powerful web application designed for writing and editing code. It combines a client-server architecture with robust features to enhance your coding experience.

### Key Features:

- **Client-Server Structure:** When you open the application in your editor, you'll see a structured client-server folder layout for seamless development.

- **Backend Startup:** Running `npm run start` from the root directory initiates the backend, serving the client and providing a smooth development environment.

- **Webpack Bundling:** Executing the text editor application in your terminal triggers Webpack to bundle your JavaScript files, optimizing performance.

- **Plugin-Generated Files:** Webpack plugins generate essential files including HTML, a service worker, and a manifest file for a complete web application experience.

- **Next-Gen JavaScript Support:** The application supports next-generation JavaScript, ensuring smooth functionality without errors.

- **IndexedDB Integration:** Upon opening the text editor, IndexedDB promptly creates a database storage for efficient content management.

- **Automatic Content Saving:** Enter content in the text editor and click off the DOM window. Your content is automatically saved using IndexedDB.

- **Persistent Content Retrieval:** Reopen the text editor after closing it, and your content is retrieved seamlessly from IndexedDB.

- **Installable Web Application:** Clicking on the Install button enables you to download the web application as an icon on your desktop.

- **Service Worker Integration:** Upon loading the web application, a registered service worker using Workbox ensures optimal performance.
